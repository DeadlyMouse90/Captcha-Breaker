# Captcha-Breaker
 
### The project aims to use web automation and machine learning for Captcha text filling.

The project followed the steps below:
1. Capturing several visions of Captcha to create an image base for ML training.
2. Removing noise from the image, making the images easier to read.
3. Separation of the Captcha letters into images, each letter corresponding to a new image.
4. Folders were created for each letter and categorization of the images in their corresponding folders.
5. Manual adjustment of the images contained in the folders, checking each folder and moving the images erroneously placed by image categorization system.
6. ML training using the generated image base.
7. Using web automation and trained ML to solve the text captcha of any desired website.
